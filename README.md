#Overview
This project delves into the sophisticated application of reinforcement learning (RL) leveraging the Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm across multiple Gymnasium environments. Specifically, the implementation of A2C is demonstrated on two well-established environments, CartPole and BipedalWalker, in addition to the development of a bespoke custom environment designed to rigorously evaluate the algorithmâ€™s effectiveness and flexibility.

##Environments

###CartPole
The CartPole environment is a seminal control problem within the RL community. The objective is to maintain the balance of a pole on a moving cart by exerting appropriate left or right forces. This environment serves as an excellent testbed for examining an agent's capability to develop stable control strategies through continuous real-time feedback and adjustment. The simplicity of the CartPole environment allows for rapid iteration and debugging, providing a clear visualization of the learning process and algorithmic performance.

###BipedalWalker
The BipedalWalker environment introduces a significantly more intricate challenge. The agent must learn to ambulate using two legs across a rugged and dynamically changing terrain. This environment necessitates the acquisition of coordinated, multi-joint movements and balance, making it an ideal scenario for testing advanced RL algorithms such as A2C. The complexity of BipedalWalker lies in its requirement for precise motor control and the ability to adapt to unforeseen obstacles and perturbations in the environment, thus providing a comprehensive assessment of the A2C algorithm's robustness and efficacy.
